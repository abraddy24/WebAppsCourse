## Commands

[git clone](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)
  ~ `git clone theRepository` (also see [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)) this will clone the repository starting in a current directory, in a subdirectory named after the project. You can add one more parameter to specify a different name.

[git status](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-status)
  ~ Shows the current status of files/directories.

[git add](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)
  ~ Adds a new or modified file to the staging area. Can be used to add multiple files too.

[git commit](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
  ~ Creates a commit from the staged changes. Use the `-m` flag to leave a message right there. You can use the `--amend` flag to amend to the previous commit instead.

[git diff](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)
  ~ Shows the difference between two versions of a file. Do `git diff --staged` to see the modifications that are staged.

`.gitignore`
  ~ A file that you can have in your project's root, indicating files and folders that should not be tracked by git.

[git log](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)
  ~ Shows you a listing of past commits. Many useful options.

[git reset](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset)
  ~ "Resets" your staging area, typically by unstaging a file.
