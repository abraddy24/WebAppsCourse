This course focuses on some of the fundamentals of software development, with a distinct emphasis on the development of rich large-scale web applications. Along the way, you will become skilled in Javascript, the programming language for the web.

We will cover such practices as:

- using a version control system to maintain ever-evolving code.
- employing extensive test suites to ensure more stable code.
- documenting your code so that both your users and future maintainers can use your application.
- modularizing your code base into manageable and reusable components.
- employing design patterns to create a common frame of reference.
- following the Pair Programming discipline which enables programmers to learn from each other.

These are all essential skills transferable to other programming languages and environments. We will also be focusing on a number of issues related specifically to Javascript programming and Web Applications, including:

- Core language features and patterns.
- Interacting with a web page and a web server.
- Handling the asynchronous nature of user interaction and network communication.
