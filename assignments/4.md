3. Write a function `makeCounter` that is similar to the one we introduced in class, but it also accepts an argument `init`, and the counter it returns will start counting from `init` instead of `1`. (So if `var a = makeCounter(10)`, then `a()` would equal 10 the first time and 11 the second time and so on from there).

4. Consider the following code:

    ```javascript
    var a = 2;
    function foo(a) { a = 6; }
    foo();
    a;
    ```

    What is the value of the variable `a` from the last line? How do you explain that?
