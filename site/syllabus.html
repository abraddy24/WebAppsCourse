<p>This course focuses on some of the fundamentals of software development, with a distinct emphasis on the development of rich large-scale web applications. Along the way, you will become skilled in Javascript, the programming language for the web.</p>
<p>We will cover such practices as:</p>
<ul>
<li>using a version control system to maintain ever-evolving code.</li>
<li>employing extensive test suites to ensure more stable code.</li>
<li>documenting your code so that both your users and future maintainers can use your application.</li>
<li>modularizing your code base into manageable and reusable components.</li>
<li>employing design patterns to create a common frame of reference.</li>
<li>following the Pair Programming discipline which enables programmers to learn from each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all essential skills transferable to other programming languages and environments. We will also be focusing on a number of issues related specifically to Javascript programming and Web Applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core language features and patterns.</li>
<li>Interacting with a web page and a web server.</li>
<li>Handling the asynchronous nature of user interaction and network communication.</li>
</ul>
